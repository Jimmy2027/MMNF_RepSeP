# RepSeP

The **Rep**roducible **Se**lf **P**ublishing toolkit demonstrates how to dynamically include publication-quality data analysis outputs in the most common science communication formats.
The toolkit uses data analysis (“content”) defined in one and only one file, and applies styling at the document or output element level.
We provide a framework for specifying or providing all dependencies (data *and* code) so that both the toolkit itself - as well as derivatives filled in with your own content - can be forked and reproduced locally and autonomosly by your colleagues, reviewers, students, and everybody else. 

This toolkit demonstrates how to reuse your favourite data analysis workflow and include results seamlessly in all formats which your outreach style may require.
Currently these are:
