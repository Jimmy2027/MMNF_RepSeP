# RepSeP

The **Rep**roducible **Se**lf **P**ublishing toolkit demonstrates how to dynamically include publication-quality data analysis output in most common science communication formats.
Data analysis is defined in one and only one place, and styling is applied at the document or output element level.
Data *and* code dependencies are provided or specified, so that both the toolkit itself - as well as your own derivatives - can be reproduced locally and autonomosly by your colleagues, reviewers, students, and everybody else. 

This toolkit demonstrates how to reuse your favourite data analysis workflow and include results seamlessly in all formats which your outreach style may require.
Currently these are:

* Presentation Slides
* Poster
* Article

## How To Self-Publish Reproducible Scientific Documents

* Clone this repository
* Edit the document files (`pres.tex`, `poster.tex`, `draft.tex`) to contain your own research output
* Compile the documents
* Distribute the output and links to your fork of this repository via your favourite channels
