# RepSeP

The **Rep**roducible **Se**lf **P**ublishing toolkit demonstrates how to dynamically include publication-quality data analysis outputs in most common science communication formats.
Data analysis (“content”) is defined in one and only one place, and styling is applied at the document or output element level.
Data *and* code dependencies are provided or specified so that both the toolkit itself - as well as derivatives filled in with your own content - can be forked and reproduced locally and autonomosly by your colleagues, reviewers, students, and everybody else. 

This toolkit demonstrates how to reuse your favourite data analysis workflow and include results seamlessly in all formats which your outreach style may require.
Currently these are:

* Presentation Slides
